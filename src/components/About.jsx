        I am a detail-oriented Frontend Developer with a passion for creating
        quality applications using JavaScript and its frameworks. My journey
        began in 2019, after completing a zero-mastery program in web
        development. Since then, I've gained hands-on experience by contributing
        to various projects and acquiring certifications in software and web
        development. <br /> <br /> Proficient in JavaScript, Typescript, Next,
        React, CSS, HTML, and more, I specialize in crafting interactive user
        interfaces and dynamic user experiences. I am confident, well-organized,
        and continuously curious about learning new technologies. I thrive on
        creative problem-solving and am perpetually working to improve my skills
        one challenge at a time. <br /> <br /> Outside of coding, you'll often
        find me on the football field or immersed in video games.
